## `🌿 STAR RATING 🌿`
[`✦ ᴅᴇᴠᴇʟᴏᴘᴍᴇɴᴛᴀʟ ᴅᴇᴘʟᴏʏᴍᴇɴᴛ`]() ◆ `✦ LINK` ◆ `✦ LINK`

    Creating a simple star rating for a project, enter a percent value (1-100) and get a rating
    in stars back. Currently works with only percents but I'm looking to implement
    difference of Inputted answer vs Expected answer with different percent difference equations
    
    EX : 
      Expected : 100
      Inputted : 80

      (1-(100-80)/100) = 80% accurate
      OR
      (1-(100-80)/((100+80)/2)) = 78% accurate
